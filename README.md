I'm excited to share a fun and functional project I recently completedâ€”a Digital and Analog Clock!

This project was a great opportunity to explore and combine fundamental web development technologies:

ðŸ”¹ HTML: To structure the clock's layout.

ðŸ”¹ CSS: For styling, including dynamic animations for the analog clock's hands.

ðŸ”¹ JavaScript: To handle time updates in real-time and sync both clocks seamlessly.



What I Learned:

âœ… How to use setInterval for real-time updates.

âœ… The math behind translating time to degrees for analog clock hands.

âœ… Combining design and logic to create a visually appealing and interactive experience.
